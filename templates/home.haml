    %li
      %b What's that?
      %br
      %p.faq
        It is an agenda that centralize events that can interest hackers in Belgium. It grabs informations by parsing hackerspaces/others website. You can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/Psycojoker/hackeragenda">here</a>.
      %p.faq
        It is a (time I can find in) one weekend project to help a community that I love and try to encourage its members to interact more together.

    %li
      %b My wonderful organization isn't present! This is SKANDALOUSE!
      %p.faq
        Either I didn't knew its existence, either I didn't found the list of event on the website (I've put organizations that I knew in Brussels + hackerspaces from hackerspaces.org/Belgium). Send me <a href="mailto: brain at worlddomination.be">an email</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Psycojoker/hackeragenda/issues/new">open a bug</a> with the correct informations (basically I need an url from which I can extract events in a structured way) or <a href="https://github.com/Psycojoker/hackeragenda">patch</a>.

    %li
      %b What kind of stuff are you ready to add?
      %p.faq
        More or less anything that can interest hackers. But right now, I haven't coded a way to filter stuff yet so I'm refraining myself a bit. A part of my mental planning is: various meetup related to programming languages/framework/tools/sysadmin/network/hardware, LUGs, hacktivism, fablabs for which I managed to find an agenda and maybe a bit out of the bubble stuff like commons good events.

    %li
      %b Can I submit an event?
      %p.faq
        No/not yet, I was too lazy/haven't got the time to code this part. Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/Psycojoker/hackeragenda">send me a patch</a>.

    %li
      %b My organization has a strange colour.
      %p.faq
        I've either try to find some kind of colour already chosen by the organization or just picked up one randomly (except for UrLab, I love pink). If you aren't happy, <a href="https://github.com/Psycojoker/hackeragenda/issues/new">open a bug</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Psycojoker/hackeragenda">send a patch</a> (edit <a href="https://github.com/Psycojoker/hackeragenda/blob/master/events/colors.py">this file</a>).

    %li
      %b Do you have an API?
      %p.faq
        Yes, you can access all the Event table <a href="/events/api/event/?format=json">here</a>. IF you want to play directly with the data used by the calendar (which is <a href="http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/">fullcalendar</a>), use <a href="{% url 'events_json' %}">this url</a>.

    %li
      %b Why so many hearts?
      %p.faq
        Because Love.
